# Frontend Authentication Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

The aicos frontend has been successfully updated with a complete authentication and multi-tenant management system. Users can now log in, manage organizations and projects, and all data is properly scoped to their context.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Authentication System âœ…

#### Components Created:
- **AuthContext** (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) - Central authentication state management
- **Login Component** (`components/auth/Login.tsx`) - User login interface
- **Signup Component** (`components/auth/Signup.tsx`) - Multi-step registration with organization creation
- **ProtectedRoute** (`components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`) - Route guard for authenticated pages

#### Features:
- JWT token management with localStorage persistence
- Automatic token injection in API requests
- Token refresh handling
- Organization/project context headers
- Loading states during authentication

### 2. User Interface Components âœ…

#### Header Components:
- **AppHeader** (`components/AppHeader.tsx`) - Main application header with org selector
- **UserMenu** (`components/UserMenu.tsx`) - User avatar dropdown with profile/logout
- **OrganizationSelector** (`components/OrganizationSelector.tsx`) - Organization and project switcher

#### Management Pages:
- **UserProfile** (`components/UserProfile.tsx`) - User profile management
- **OrganizationSettings** (`components/OrganizationSettings.tsx`) - Organization management with tabs:
  - General settings
  - Member management
  - Usage statistics

### 3. API Service Layer âœ…

Created a centralized API service (`services/api.ts`) with:
- Axios instance with interceptors
- Automatic authentication header injection
- Token refresh on 401 errors
- Organization/project context headers
- Organized API methods by domain:
  - Auth endpoints
  - Organization management
  - Project management
  - Q&A, Affirmations, Content, etc.

### 4. Route Protection âœ…

Updated `App.tsx` with:
- Authentication provider wrapper
- Public routes (login, signup)
- Protected routes for all features
- Conditional UI based on auth state
- New routes for profile and settings

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Authentication Flow

1. **First Time Users**:
   - Navigate to `/signup`
   - Enter personal details
   - Create organization
   - Automatically logged in

2. **Existing Users**:
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Enter credentials
   - Select organization/project from header

### 3. Key UI Elements

- **Organization Selector**: Top navigation bar - switch between organizations/projects
- **User Menu**: Top right avatar - access profile, settings, logout
- **Protected Pages**: All feature pages now require authentication

### 4. API Integration

All components can now use the centralized API service:

```typescript
import { apiService } from '../services/api';

// Example: Ask a question
const response = await apiService.qa.askQuestion('What are the 7 cycles?');

// Example: Generate affirmations
const response = await apiService.affirmations.generate({
  period_name: 'Energie',
  count: 5
});
```

## Features Implemented

### Authentication Features:
- âœ… User registration with organization creation
- âœ… User login with JWT tokens
- âœ… Persistent sessions (24-hour tokens)
- âœ… Automatic token refresh
- âœ… Logout functionality

### Multi-Tenant Features:
- âœ… Organization selector in header
- âœ… Project selector within organizations
- âœ… Context headers in all API requests
- âœ… Create new organizations/projects
- âœ… Switch between multiple organizations

### User Management:
- âœ… User profile editing
- âœ… Password change functionality
- âœ… View organization memberships
- âœ… Avatar with user initials

### Organization Management:
- âœ… Edit organization details
- âœ… Invite team members
- âœ… Manage member roles
- âœ… View usage statistics
- âœ… Subscription tier display

## UI/UX Highlights

1. **German Language**: Interface uses German for better user experience
2. **Material-UI Design**: Consistent with existing components
3. **Responsive Layout**: Works on mobile and desktop
4. **Loading States**: Proper feedback during async operations
5. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
6. **Multi-Step Signup**: Guided registration process

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Remaining Tasks:
1. Update remaining components to use `apiService` instead of direct axios calls
2. Add project management UI component
3. Implement user invitation acceptance flow
4. Add subscription management interface

### Enhancements:
1. Remember me functionality
2. Social login integration
3. Two-factor authentication
4. Session timeout warnings
5. Activity notifications

## Migration Guide

For existing components that need to be updated:

1. Replace `axios` imports with `apiService`:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   import axios from 'axios';
   const response = await axios.post(`${API_BASE_URL}/endpoint`, data);
   
   // After
   import { apiService } from '../services/api';
   const response = await apiService.domain.method(data);
   ```

2. Remove `API_BASE_URL` constants (now handled by apiService)

3. Remove manual auth headers (automatically added by interceptors)

## Testing

1. **Test Login**:
   - Use existing credentials or create new account
   - Verify redirect to dashboard
   - Check organization selector populated

2. **Test Protected Routes**:
   - Try accessing any feature without login
   - Should redirect to login page
   - After login, redirects back to intended page

3. **Test Multi-Tenant**:
   - Create multiple organizations
   - Switch between them
   - Verify data isolation

4. **Test Token Expiry**:
   - Set token to expire
   - Make API call
   - Should auto-refresh or redirect to login

## Conclusion

The frontend now has a complete authentication and multi-tenant management system that matches the backend implementation. Users can securely access their organizations, manage teams, and all data is properly scoped to their context. The implementation follows React best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing Material-UI components.
