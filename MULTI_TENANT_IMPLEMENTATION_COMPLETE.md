# Multi-Tenant Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

The aicos application has been successfully transformed from a single-tenant to a multi-tenant architecture. This implementation provides complete data isolation, role-based access control, and organization/project-based content management.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema âœ…
- **9 migration files** created for complete multi-tenant support:
  - Organizations with subscription tiers
  - Projects within organizations
  - Users with authentication
  - Membership tables (organization & project)
  - API key management
  - Audit logging
  - Row-level security policies
  - Password storage

### 2. Authentication System âœ…
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure token generation
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt
- **Role-based access control** (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- **API endpoints**:
  - `/auth/signup` - User registration with organization
  - `/auth/login` - User authentication
  - `/auth/logout` - Session termination
  - `/auth/me` - Current user info
  - `/auth/api-keys` - API key management

### 3. Context Middleware âœ…
- **Request context injection** for organization/project scoping
- **Multi-tenant middleware** for access control
- **Audit logging middleware** for compliance
- Automatic context propagation throughout the application

### 4. Agent Migrations âœ…
All agents have been migrated to support multi-tenancy:

1. **QA Agent** - Organization-specific knowledge bases
2. **Affirmations Agent** - Scoped affirmation generation
3. **Content Workflow Agent** - Multi-tenant workflow management
4. **Visual Post Creator Agent** - Organization-scoped visual content
5. **Post Composition Agent** - Isolated post compositions
6. **Video Generation Agent** - Scoped video creation
7. **Hashtag Research Agent** - Organization-specific content

### 5. API Endpoint Updates âœ…
All major endpoints now require authentication and support multi-tenancy:

- **Q&A endpoints** (`/api/ask-question`, `/api/qa-health`)
- **Affirmations endpoints** (`/generate-affirmations`, `/affirmations`)
- **Content endpoints** (`/content/*`)
- **Workflow endpoints** (`/api/workflows/*`)
- **Visual posts endpoints** (`/visual-posts/*`)
- **All other content generation endpoints**

### 6. Management Endpoints âœ…
New endpoints for organization and project management:

#### Organization Management (`/api/organizations/*`)
- List user's organizations
- Create/update/delete organizations
- Manage organization members
- Organization settings and usage statistics

#### Project Management (`/api/projects/*`)
- List projects within organizations
- Create/update/delete projects
- Manage project members
- Project settings and activity logs

### 7. Storage Abstraction âœ…
- **Scoped storage adapter** pattern for automatic data isolation
- All agents use the `StorageAdapter` interface
- Transparent multi-tenancy at the storage layer
- Support for both Supabase and local storage

## Architecture Highlights

### Security Features
- **Row-level security (RLS)** for complete data isolation
- **JWT tokens** with configurable expiration
- **Secure password hashing** with bcrypt
- **API key management** for programmatic access
- **Audit trail** for all write operations

### Multi-Tenant Patterns
- **Context injection** at API layer
- **Scoped storage adapter** pattern
- **Automatic organization/project filtering**
- **Backward compatibility** for gradual migration

### Data Isolation
- Each organization's data is completely isolated
- Projects provide additional scoping within organizations
- All queries automatically filtered by context
- No data leakage between tenants

## How to Use

### 1. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Follow the migration guide
cd backend/migrations
# Use Supabase Dashboard or CLI to run SQL files
```

### 2. Start the Backend
```bash
npm run dev-backend
```

### 3. Create a User and Organization
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "organization_name": "My Organization"
  }'
```

### 4. Use the Access Token
```bash
# Save the access_token from signup response
ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Make authenticated requests
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ask-question \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the 7 cycles?"}'
```

### 5. Create Projects
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Marketing Campaign",
    "description": "Q1 2025 Campaign",
    "organization_id": "your_org_id"
  }'
```

## Test Scripts

Two test scripts are available:

1. **`backend/test_auth_flow.py`** - Tests authentication flow
2. **`backend/test_affirmations_auth.py`** - Tests multi-tenant affirmations

Run them with:
```bash
python backend/test_auth_flow.py
python backend/test_affirmations_auth.py
```

## Migration Status

âœ… **Core Infrastructure**: Complete
âœ… **All Agents**: Migrated to multi-tenant
âœ… **All API Endpoints**: Protected with authentication
âœ… **Management APIs**: Organization and project endpoints created
âœ… **Storage Layer**: Full multi-tenant support
âœ… **Test Scripts**: Created and functional

## Next Steps

### Frontend Integration
1. Add authentication UI components
2. Implement organization/project selectors
3. Update API client with authentication headers
4. Add user profile management

### Enhanced Features
1. User invitation system
2. Subscription tier management
3. Usage analytics dashboard
4. Advanced permission management
5. Webhook integrations

### Production Readiness

2. Implement caching strategy
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Create backup and recovery procedures
5. Document API with OpenAPI schemas

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Authentication
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-random-key-here
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=1440  # 24 hours
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=30

# Database (existing)
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

## Conclusion

The multi-tenant implementation is complete and fully functional. The system now supports:

- Multiple organizations with complete data isolation
- Project-based content organization
- Role-based access control
- Secure authentication with JWT
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Scalable architecture for growth

All agents and APIs have been migrated to support multi-tenancy while maintaining backward compatibility. The system is ready for testing and frontend integration.

ðŸš€ The aicos platform is now enterprise-ready with full multi-tenant support!
